# Symfony Challenge

## Context
> The task is not difficult, but it will show how well you can make use of information available online and your 
> knowledge of PHP / HTML / CSS / JS to come to a good solution.

## Briefing
Using the latest version of Symfony, create a page where  one can upload an XLSX file and receive a CSV file in return, and inversely, send a CSV file and receive a XLSX file in return. 
You can of course use a library for the files conversion.

In order to test your JS / CSS / HTML knowledge a bit:

- Provide two beautiful buttons (one for csv and one for .xlsx) so you do not have to show the ugly  default browser buttons.
- Line from the buttons on the center (vertical + horizontal) of the display.
- Make sure everything looks the same in IE11, Edge, Chrome and Firefox
- On mobile are the buttons under each other over the entire width
- Make sure only the file format (.csv or .xlsx) can be uploaded.
